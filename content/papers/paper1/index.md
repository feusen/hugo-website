This paper is in early stages of development; aiming to have a working abstract and workshop presentation slide deck available at the end of this quarter (fall 2025).

##### Abstract

Housing discrimination can have intense impacts on short-term, long-term, and even intergenerational outcomes in health, education, labor, and crime contributing to racial inequality. This early-stage work seeks to explore how individuals' financial attributes, such as credit score, may "compensate" for demographic-based discrimination in facilitating access to rental housing using UC's Consumer Credit Panel and housing discrimination data generated from the field experiment conducted by Christensen et al. (2021).
